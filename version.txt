    future things for this site specifically
    - jukebox that plays unreleased soundcloud(hidden behind easter egg) corny ik but it's a part of me.
    
    - it'll be especially drawn in my notebook and be noted on the PORTFOLIO page

    - v2 will have the portfolio page and the beginning of webhooking to discord and other platforms (via tumblr)
    we will get to this part around the beginning of may.
    v2 will come with +10 cursors, 2 of them hidden behind easter eggs on the website :P


THE FUTURE

- develop 3 different kinds of applications.
learn PYTHON and JAVA
create 

- soundcloud artist music downloader (can download profiles, can download playlists)
- the reason i want to create this app is because of the prevalance of alot of problematic artists in the community
when an artist makes good music but has bad deeds, it makes me feel bad that i enjoyed the music of such an individual
therefore, i'd like to completely negate kind of money or monetization i'd give thart artist via downloading their music.
alot of soundcloud downloaders like this exist already, however i am planning on making mine special and unique by creating skins and have it more
community oriented rather than just archive-oriented.

- a bone designed jukebox app/skin for a music player that loads in songs from different platforms. it will use the platforms apis and won't directly use files unless commanded by the user.
it will have those 2 functions accessible. it's not really something crazy i want to develop. i just want to branch out my skills lol. make different cute shit. could probably do it braindead easy.

<SCRAPPED> apr.12.2025

- an idea surrounding the fact that users have to download multiple different applications to do several kinds of operations on the windows pc 
so, let me create an application that acts as a 'toolbox' or 'kit' that can do multiple things in one by attaching ui elements together.
it'll be super customizable and open-source, people can build upon it. the capabilities it should have are abilities to
        convert files (mp3 to mp4, but you have to attach an image, webP to PNG, JPEG to SVG, ico to JPG, bat to .exe,)
        autoclick (as an extension)
        play music (local files)
        read out system information
        process system resource usage (like task manager)
        customize its skins and be able to create its own skin via 1 coding language powered by the machine locally (can be shared and exported upon corsadia website's)

have them downloadable from my website. (for nerds <3)

***you can see im not enjoying this. i pretend to enjoy it because i know its something im going to be doing for the rest of my life and it doesnt feel as good as everything else i do.
 it's really a lack of motivation and a lack of caring about the craft that im trying to hone. 
 it feels all performative. but its' really not. but isn't everything performative. i only really said this because it was 8 days since i last touched this website seriously. 
 i need a geek bar. i dont. but damn. i wish i never hit one. i wouldn't want it every minute if i had never hit it. 
 but why does it have to suck? if only geek bars were as healthy as apples.***

    understand the credits and how to reach the owner of the website for suggestions if they don't have my other social media.

APRIL 1ST - APRIL 2ND MIDNIGHT

    - this marks the beginning of actually learning what html does. not that i don't know, 
    but knowledge will be retained from this point onward by 
    including what i learned at the end of every version change. they will all be marked with STARS in this text.

    - starting now, version changes will involve a 3rd number (won't be vX.X anymore, since i am going
    to be adding more complex things into this website, and will make small changes to understand what i learn as i progress.)
    - version will now capture the last 50 lines to ensure everything is chronologically ordered.
     
    ⭐ to center a div, all we need is to make sure the body has a position, and a position of relative or absolute depending on the 
    pages content. then you can apply either display: flex; or display: grid;, then for flex; you have to align it vertically via align-items: center;
    and align it horizontally with justify-content: center;. you can also assign flex-direction: row; or column; so they are organized in the relevant manner.

    ⭐ always ensure the body has a 100vh; so that it'll reflect on all screens (mobile, tablet, other browsers)

    ⭐ @daidarkcel is a fabled legend of the past. i'm rlly not but its cool to dream so please.
    
    ⭐ to change font-sizes, always use font-size: []px or []em.

    ⭐ @keyframes [identifer] is basically the easiest way to make up an animation and then assign it in the correlating element with animation: [identifier]
    for example, @keyframes cumAnim (weird right) becomes
    @keyframes cumAnim {
        0% {
            opacity: 0.2;
        }
        25% {
            opacity: 0.5;
        }
        50%
        {
            opacity: 0.3;
        }

        75% {
            opacity: 0.8
        }
        
        100% {
            opacity: 1;
                }
    }

    and is then turn into

    [whatever element] {

        animation: cumAnim 2s;
        <this assigns the animation that was created, you spawned the keyframes for that new animation. there are aways to speed up animations
        with ease-in; and ease;

    }





v0.9.1

APRIL 2ND, 2025 fuck april foos.


- index.html is updated, with a cursor selection prompt screen appearing once the user clicks on the newly rotating bone animation done by urs truly <3
    there are 3 cursors the user can choose from. they can also skip this process if they don't care and get sent straight to the darknest page. (or WIP depending on occasion)
    cursors are the flesh axe of darkness, and the flesh axe of darkness 3. there are more cursors to come, and most of them will be based of dorohedoro/dai dark weapons or characters

    - cursors will be called from a different linksheet (cursor.css) and will be provided for download via an easter egg page (if you're a nerd I LOVE NERDS)
    - im stoned right now
    - a gradient animation was added to one of the span ids in the footer. it is for those who use Dark Reader ( i am a dark reader user and honestly i want to finish the site
    so i am leaving the dark reader problem for the future)
    - the footer now has a disclaimer about dark reader users. i added a hyperlink to the extensions settings ( i checked online the extension id to make sure it's not a local id ) so anyone can go to it.
    - added new glass styling, thanks alot internet, this is a p simple way of just having things look decent on someones first website
    - blog is update with new inputs and myspace/tumblr type of feeling. animated swirly dorohedoro background (not rlly mine but credited in legacy) to make my things look more extensive.
    - admin panel receives glass styling as well.
    - basically the sSTLYINGtylingSTYLINg update. alot of styles are getting inputted and fixed with v1.0.0, so expect the site to look pretty good for a first website. expect glass panels, animations, special effects, and simple but clean, beginner navigation.

    - shop panel finally has a proper WIP section. ( it will have actual clothes of mine there, just not right now. currently i linked my depop and mercari to help fund this new business)

                ⭐  understand that this is a portfolio website. i want to showcase my skills to the world before i die miserably or happily however the world wants to recognize me.
                        ⭐ understand that for this thing to get anywhere its' going to take some time and some perserverance. there will be days i dont feel like doing this shit at all and days where i will. the point is
                            to take advantages of the days i can.

    - finalization of the credits screen. it will be periodically updated.
    - have a plan for an amount of updates per month.
            ⚫ every month should have at least 2 published updates to the website.
                every 2-3 months should have 2 major updates to the website.


    - everythings pretty much ready for release.
    - don't forget that all versions and minor versions after this will have 3 letters in them.
    vX.X.X is the new format! lets go. 
    -


v0.9.2

APRIL 6th 2025


- 
- added 2 new pages, portfolio.html and test.html

test.html is for testing new things without publishing them yet. it'll be locked behind a password page. it can't be accessible to anyone but me. it'll be connected to admin via a <ahref> tag

portfolio is for my portfolio, what im working on exactly at the moment. whatever is finished will be uploaded to the site. there are different volumes

- added testpage.css for a custom look for the test page. 
- modern.css was renamed to main.css for easier access and it makes better sense that way, it is the main part of the page


as of right now there are 13 pages on this website.



nothing will be published UNTIL everything in the modern/main version is setup. once thats done, legacy can remain a WIP.


V0.9.3

APRIL 8TH 2025

- the navigation bar is now pushed towards a completely seperate css file as well. everything that will appear more than twice on this site will just have its styling derived from a seperate css, rather than clumping css into 1 file.v (nav.css)

there will be only a few exceptions.

navigation appears on every page except for the darknest page.

cursor selection can be accessed on the bottom right corner of every site as well, you can reopen the window. by clicking the cursor icon.


v0.9.3a
(04/12)
-  the idea for the soundcloud media creator is scrapped. since winamp is still a thing, taking its idea and revamping it wouldn't prove anything. it'll be cool to revive but the ideas not original and thats what i desire for this project.

the new idea will come shortly, but other ideas are still pending as of now. the jukebox will still be drawn,
but it will serve a different purpose on the website, as a custom media player for any audio i want to share/broadcast on the site.

- however the idea will remain possible for an extension of my netkit (onettz) [based on earthbound]
 which will be an application that serves as a host for many utilities alot of internet users use 
 such as youtube-dl, soundcloud-dl, converting files to gifs,



 +++ added an infinitely scrolling display below my profile to showcase the programming languages i currently know and possess. it also shows the one im learning for future internship possiblities. <SCRAPPED>
 
 +++ created an entire portfolio page for the modern side, the legacy one will be added later (v2!!!)
we're almost towards the mid april mark. theres alot this website has to go under before we make actual progress.
 there are 2 volumes. when i run out of space there will simply be other volume. i also want to have volumes as a way to categorize what kind of ideas i want to push out on my future clothing ideas.


 +++ in the end i kind of just wanna be that geek that knows how to make shoes. sometimes i feel like i dont wanna do it simply bc i dont wanna do it and have th emotivation maybe im lying to myself but honestly i think thats just mental issues that im going through right now. anyways, lets get this shit going bc im stoned and i do not want to melt in my own feelings about shi that dont rlly matter rn.
 
4/18

- made a seperate css for copyright and gave the copyright at the bottom an animation. when fading in. it'll be closer to the version logo as well.
