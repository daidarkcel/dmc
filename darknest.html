    <p>welcome to darknest // corsadia, my name's peace.</p>
    i'm a graphic designer, developer, and digital artist.
    here you'll find the navigation hub that'll link to my shop, portfolio, profile and credits.
    I'm currently in college at Borough of Manhattan Community College and I'm a MMP-AD major, Multimedia Programming and Design. In the future I plan to do freelance work to be able to showcase my skill amongst those who appreciate them. 
    <h2>what's in the works?</h2>
        <ul class = "futureprojects">
            <li>mini custom cursor app/selector</li>
            <li class = "onettz">customizable media downloader, player and converter.
                <p>I plan on making it free forever. I want it to be the last piece of me before I leave this earth. However, I don't think I can do this alone. If you're willing to join  me on this journey, please let me know! [this is a passion project]</p>

        <h3>what actually is 'CORSADIA'?</h3>
        <p class = "truthofcorsadia">
            to be honest, not even i know. the original plan for 'corsadia' was to be a band at first, but realizing those goals aren't really feasible, i decided to have corsadia be like an amalgamation of myself. expect all extensions of me as a person on this site.

    <h4>FAQ</h4>
    <ul>
        
        <li>what's the future of this website?</li>
            <p>there are alot of things planned that I probably can't put in this FAQ section, you'll have to go to the releases page.</p>

        <li>what does "CORSADIA" mean?</li>
            <p>the name doesn't have any real significance. i discovered the word in a comment section of one of my favorite soundcloud tracks, and something just clicked mentally. it sounded really unique and cool, so i researched the name before taking it for myself. rebrands are always possible, due to this fact. </p>

        <li>hey! i sent an email back and haven't gotten a reply!</li>
            <p>if you're expecting a reply back from me, please contact me via any of my social media linked on the site's <a href= "profile.html" class = "profile-rd">profile.</a> </p>
