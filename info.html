	<h1>the story of "afrogoth" begins here.</h1>
		<h2> AFROGOTH is a planned genre-fusion music collective with only 1 member and founder DUMRAVEKID.</h2>
		<p> The plan for this upcoming underground collective is that it will be incorporating several genres of music like post-punk, rock, gabber and hardstyle, trap and tread, and a plethora of other high tempo and high energy beats that are full of rivalry expression and the feeling of insanity. </p>
		<p> There is another plan to name the collective 'CORSADIA' the inspiration comes from a random soundcloud comment section. (lol) It may also be called "KORSADIA" for the logo to have a more angular appeal.</p>
