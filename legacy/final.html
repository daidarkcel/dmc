<h1>mmp 100 final video project</h1>

<p> 
	this is a project i did at the end of my first semester at college. i was in a class called multimedia production, and we were tasked with making a video project using after effects, illustrator and photoshop and only shape tools. i decided to make a music video for the song "blunt kiss" by the band "the garden". i had a lot of fun making this project, and it was a great way to learn about video editing and production. i hope you enjoy it!
