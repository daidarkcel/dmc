</h1> Multimedia Final Project Video</h1>
<p> This is the final project from my MMP 100 Introduction to Multimedia course.
	It features my character, Vermi, a person who is into goth and rave subcultures.
	However, they don't really know much of the rave scene, they haven't even been to one.
	Not like that matters anyway, because in this short they investigate a cute dead lighter! </p>
