<div class="explanation?">
    <p>I'm not going to lie. I just wanted to give myself something to do, that's why when making this website, i was like, i should have 2 versions,
        one that's normally accessible, the other one that's someones first website. i wanted to be able to understand myself better, and i think i did, 
        especially seeing my growth between both versions which is why im going to keep this up.
        i'm going to essentially make this like my new twitter or something. i'll link like everything i do here, it'll be a hub for all my shit lol.
