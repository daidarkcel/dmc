                 She is the fabled legend behind these 2 pieces of my favorite media. She is the main heavy inspiration behind the design of this site. Please give them a read if you haven't already.

                the 'SHOP', 'PROFILE', 'CREDS', logos were all transformative edits done by me via extracting bones from the manga, converting to .PNG and using them to create a logo with a transparent background.

                <br>
                'CORSADIA', 'KORSADIA' are handmade drawn logos by me. Please if you'd like to use them contact me.
