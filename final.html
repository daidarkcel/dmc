</h1> Multimedia Final Project Video</h1>
<p> This is the final project from my MMP 100 Introduction to Multimedia course.
	It features my character, Vermi, a person who is into goth and rave subcultures.
	However, they don't really know much of the rave scene, they haven't even been to one.
	So, she ventures out alone to a underground rave being hosted behind a bridge somewhere in the Upper Bronx. </p>
